pkg:pypi/requestsVulnerable Dependencyrequests[>=0,<=1.2.3]0:ÛAdvisory: Specific versions of Requests are susceptible to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. This vulnerability is triggered when an incorrect password is sent in a digest authentication request, causing the library to indefinitely retry the request. Such behavior can be exploited by an attacker to send numerous requests, leading to a service outage by overwhelming the system's resources.

pkg:pypi/requestsVulnerable Dependencyrequests[>=2.3.0,<2.31.0]0:óAdvisory: Requests 2.31.0 includes a fix for CVE-2023-32681: Since Requests 2.3.0, Requests has been leaking Proxy-Authorization headers to destination servers when redirected to an HTTPS endpoint. This is a product of how we use 'rebuild_proxies' to reattach the 'Proxy-Authorization' header to requests. For HTTP connections sent through the tunnel, the proxy will identify the header in the request itself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination server. However when sent over HTTPS, the 'Proxy-Authorization' header must be sent in the CONNECT request as the proxy has no visibility into the tunneled request. This results in Requests forwarding proxy credentials to the destination server unintentionally, allowing a malicious actor to potentially exfiltrate sensitive information.

pkg:pypi/cryptographyVulnerable Dependencycryptography[<42.0.8]0:ªAdvisory: The `cryptography` library has updated its BoringSSL and OpenSSL dependencies in CI due to a security concern. Specifically, the issue involves the functions `EVP_PKEY_param_check()` and `EVP_PKEY_public_check()`, which are used to check DSA public keys or parameters. These functions can experience significant delays when processing excessively long DSA keys or parameters, potentially leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) if the input is from an untrusted source. The vulnerability arises because the key and parameter check functions do not limit the modulus size during checks, despite OpenSSL not allowing public keys with a modulus over 10,000 bits for signature verification. This issue affects applications that directly call these functions and the OpenSSL `pkey` and `pkeyparam` command-line applications with the `-check` option. The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not impacted, but the OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are affected by this vulnerability.

pkg:pypi/cryptographyVulnerable Dependencycryptography[<42.0.2]0:˜Advisory: The cryptography library has updated its OpenSSL dependency in CI due to security concerns. This vulnerability arises when processing maliciously formatted PKCS12 files, which can cause OpenSSL to crash, leading to a potential Denial of Service (DoS) attack. PKCS12 files, often containing certificates and keys, may come from untrusted sources. The PKCS12 specification allows certain fields to be NULL, but OpenSSL does not correctly handle these cases, resulting in a NULL pointer dereference and subsequent crash. Applications using OpenSSL APIs, such as PKCS12_parse(), PKCS12_unpack_p7data(), PKCS12_unpack_p7encdata(), PKCS12_unpack_authsafes(), and PKCS12_newpass(), are vulnerable if they process PKCS12 files from untrusted sources. Although a similar issue in SMIME_write_PKCS7() was fixed, it is not considered significant for security as it pertains to data writing. This issue does not affect the FIPS modules in versions 3.2, 3.1, and 3.0.

pkg:pypi/cryptographyVulnerable Dependencycryptography[>=35.0.0,<42.0.6]0:èAdvisory: The `cryptography` library updates its BoringSSL and OpenSSL dependencies in CI due to a security concern. Specifically, certain non-default TLS server configurations can cause unbounded memory growth when processing TLSv1.3 sessions, leading to a potential Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The issue arises when the `SSL_OP_NO_TICKET` option is used without early data support and default anti-replay protection. Under these conditions, the session cache can become misconfigured, preventing it from flushing properly and causing it to grow indefinitely. A malicious client can exploit this scenario to trigger a DoS attack, although it can also occur accidentally during normal operations. This vulnerability affects only TLS servers supporting TLSv1.3 and does not impact TLS clients. Additionally, the FIPS modules in versions 3.2, 3.1, and 3.0, as well as OpenSSL 1.0.2, are not affected by this issue.

Advisory: Checking excessively long invalid RSA public keys may take a long time. Applications that use the function EVP_PKEY_public_check() to check RSA public keys may experience long delays. Where the key that is being checked has been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service. When function EVP_PKEY_public_check() is called on RSA public keys, a computation is done to confirm that the RSA modulus, n, is composite. For valid RSA keys, n is a product of two or more large primes and this computation completes quickly. However, if n is an overly large prime, then this computation would take a long time. An application that calls EVP_PKEY_public_check() and supplies an RSA key obtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack. The function EVP_PKEY_public_check() is not called from other OpenSSL functions however it is called from the OpenSSL pkey command line application. For that reason that application is also vulnerable if used with the '-pubin' and '-check' options on untrusted data. The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue. The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are affected by this issue.

pkg:pypi/pyjwtVulnerable Dependencypyjwt[>=1.5.0,<2.4.0]0:ÿAdvisory: PyJWT 2.4.0 includes a fix for CVE-2022-29217: An attacker submitting the JWT token can choose the used signing algorithm. The PyJWT library requires that the application chooses what algorithms are supported. The application can specify 'jwt.algorithms.get_default_algorithms()' to get support for all algorithms, or specify a single algorithm. The issue is not that big as 'algorithms=jwt.algorithms.get_default_algorithms()' has to be used. As a workaround, always be explicit with the algorithms that are accepted and expected when decoding.

pkg:pypi/pyjwtVulnerable Dependencypyjwt[<1.5.1]0:¬Advisory: In PyJWT 1.5.0 and below the `invalid_strings` check in `HMACAlgorithm.prepare_key` does not account for all PEM encoded public keys. Specifically, the PKCS1 PEM encoded format would be allowed because it is prefaced with the string `-----BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY-----` which is not accounted for. This enables symmetric/asymmetric key confusion attacks against users using the PKCS1 PEM encoded public keys, which would allow an attacker to craft JWTs from scratch.

pkg:pypi/flaskVulnerable Dependencyflask[<2.2.5 >=2.3.0,<2.3.2]0: 
Advisory: Flask 2.2.5 and 2.3.2 include a fix for CVE-2023-30861: When all of the following conditions are met, a response containing data intended for one client may be cached and subsequently sent by the proxy to other clients. If the proxy also caches 'Set-Cookie' headers, it may send one client's 'session' cookie to other clients. The severity depends on the application's use of the session and the proxy's behavior regarding cookies. The risk depends on all these conditions being met:
1. The application must be hosted behind a caching proxy that does not strip cookies or ignore responses with cookies.
2. The application sets 'session.permanent = True'
3. The application does not access or modify the session at any point during a request.
4. 'SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST' enabled (the default).
5. The application does not set a 'Cache-Control' header to indicate that a page is private or should not be cached.
This happens because vulnerable versions of Flask only set the 'Vary: Cookie' header when the session is accessed or modified, not when it is refreshed (re-sent to update the expiration) without being accessed or modified.

This is a product of how we use 'rebuild_proxies' to reattach the 'Proxy-Authorization' header to requests. For HTTP connections sent through the tunnel, the proxy will identify the header in the request itself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination server. However when sent over HTTPS, the 'Proxy-Authorization' header must be sent in the CONNECT request as the proxy has no visibility into the tunneled request. This results in Requests forwarding proxy credentials to the destination server unintentionally, allowing a malicious actor to potentially exfiltrate sensitive information.

pkg:pypi/cryptographyVulnerable Dependencycryptography[<42.0.8]0:ªAdvisory: The `cryptography` library has updated its BoringSSL and OpenSSL dependencies in CI due to a security concern. Specifically, the issue involves the functions `EVP_PKEY_param_check()` and `EVP_PKEY_public_check()`, which are used to check DSA public keys or parameters. These functions can experience significant delays when processing excessively long DSA keys or parameters, potentially leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) if the input is from an untrusted source. The vulnerability arises because the key and parameter check functions do not limit the modulus size during checks, despite OpenSSL not allowing public keys with a modulus over 10,000 bits for signature verification. This issue affects applications that directly call these functions and the OpenSSL `pkey` and `pkeyparam` command-line applications with the `-check` option. The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not impacted, but the OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are affected by this vulnerability.

pkg:pypi/cryptographyVulnerable Dependencycryptography[<42.0.2]0:˜Advisory: The cryptography library has updated its OpenSSL dependency in CI due to security concerns. This vulnerability arises when processing maliciously formatted PKCS12 files, which can cause OpenSSL to crash, leading to a potential Denial of Service (DoS) attack. PKCS12 files, often containing certificates and keys, may come from untrusted sources. The PKCS12 specification allows certain fields to be NULL, but OpenSSL does not correctly handle these cases, resulting in a NULL pointer dereference and subsequent crash. Applications using OpenSSL APIs, such as PKCS12_parse(), PKCS12_unpack_p7data(), PKCS12_unpack_p7encdata(), PKCS12_unpack_authsafes(), and PKCS12_newpass(), are vulnerable if they process PKCS12 files from untrusted sources. Although a similar issue in SMIME_write_PKCS7() was fixed, it is not considered significant for security as it pertains to data writing. This issue does not affect the FIPS modules in versions 3.2, 3.1, and 3.0.

pkg:pypi/cryptographyVulnerable Dependencycryptography[>=35.0.0,<42.0.6]0:èAdvisory: The `cryptography` library updates its BoringSSL and OpenSSL dependencies in CI due to a security concern. Specifically, certain non-default TLS server configurations can cause unbounded memory growth when processing TLSv1.3 sessions, leading to a potential Denial of Service (DoS) attack. The issue arises when the `SSL_OP_NO_TICKET` option is used without early data support and default anti-replay protection. Under these conditions, the session cache can become misconfigured, preventing it from flushing properly and causing it to grow indefinitely. A malicious client can exploit this scenario to trigger a DoS attack, although it can also occur accidentally during normal operations. This vulnerability affects only TLS servers supporting TLSv1.3 and does not impact TLS clients. Additionally, the FIPS modules in versions 3.2, 3.1, and 3.0, as well as OpenSSL 1.0.2, are not affected by this issue.

However, when Python is run with '-O' these asserts are optimized  away.  If a user ran Python with this flag and got an invalid response code, this could lead to undefined behavior or worse.

pkg:pypi/cryptographyVulnerable Dependencycryptography[>=35.0.0,<42.0.2]0:‚
Advisory: Checking excessively long invalid RSA public keys may take a long time. Applications that use the function EVP_PKEY_public_check() to check RSA public keys may experience long delays. Where the key that is being checked has been obtained from an untrusted source this may lead to a Denial of Service. When function EVP_PKEY_public_check() is called on RSA public keys, a computation is done to confirm that the RSA modulus, n, is composite. For valid RSA keys, n is a product of two or more large primes and this computation completes quickly. However, if n is an overly large prime, then this computation would take a long time. An application that calls EVP_PKEY_public_check() and supplies an RSA key obtained from an untrusted source could be vulnerable to a Denial of Service attack. The function EVP_PKEY_public_check() is not called from other OpenSSL functions however it is called from the OpenSSL pkey command line application. For that reason that application is also vulnerable if used with the '-pubin' and '-check' options on untrusted data. The OpenSSL SSL/TLS implementation is not affected by this issue. The OpenSSL 3.0 and 3.1 FIPS providers are affected by this issue.

This disruption might result in false calculations or cause a denial of service. The vulnerability's exploitation hinges on the attacker's ability to alter the algorithm's application and the dependency of the software on non-volatile XMM registers.

The PyJWT library requires that the application chooses what algorithms are supported. The application can specify 'jwt.algorithms.get_default_algorithms()' to get support for all algorithms, or specify a single algorithm. The issue is not that big as 'algorithms=jwt.algorithms.get_default_algorithms()' has to be used. As a workaround, always be explicit with the algorithms that are accepted and expected when decoding.

Specifically, the PKCS1 PEM encoded format would be allowed because it is prefaced with the string `-----BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY-----` which is not accounted for. This enables symmetric/asymmetric key confusion attacks against users using the PKCS1 PEM encoded public keys, which would allow an attacker to craft JWTs from scratch.

Advisory: Flask 2.2.5 and 2.3.2 include a fix for CVE-2023-30861: When all of the following conditions are met, a response containing data intended for one client may be cached and subsequently sent by the proxy to other clients. If the proxy also caches 'Set-Cookie' headers, it may send one client's 'session' cookie to other clients. The severity depends on the application's use of the session and the proxy's behavior regarding cookies. The risk depends on all these conditions being met:
1. The application must be hosted behind a caching proxy that does not strip cookies or ignore responses with cookies.
2. The application sets 'session.permanent = True'
3. The application does not access or modify the session at any point during a request.
4. 'SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST' enabled (the default).
5. The application does not set a 'Cache-Control' header to indicate that a page is private or should not be cached.
This happens because vulnerable versions of Flask only set the 'Vary: Cookie' header when the session is accessed or modified, not when it is refreshed (re-sent to update the expiration) without being accessed or modified.
