jinja2:2.10Vulnerable Dependencyjinja2[>=0]0:ï¿½Advisory: In Jinja2, the from_string function is prone to Server Side Template Injection (SSTI) where it takes the "source" parameter as a template object, renders it, and then returns it. The attacker can exploit it with {{INJECTION COMMANDS}} in a URI. 
NOTE: The maintainer and multiple third parties believe that this vulnerability isn't valid because users shouldn't use untrusted templates without sandboxing.

jinja2:2.10Vulnerable Dependencyjinja2[<3.1.3]0:ï¿½Advisory: Jinja2 before 3.1.3 is affected by a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability. Special placeholders in the template allow writing code similar to Python syntax. It is possible to inject arbitrary HTML attributes into the rendered HTML template. The Jinja 'xmlattr' filter can be abused to inject arbitrary HTML attribute keys and values, bypassing the auto escaping mechanism and potentially leading to XSS. It may also be possible to bypass attribute validation checks if they are blacklist-based.

jinja2:2.10Vulnerable Dependencyjinja2[<2.11.3]0:ï¿½Advisory: This affects the package jinja2 from 0.0.0 and before 2.11.3. The ReDoS vulnerability is mainly due to the '_punctuation_re regex' operator and its use of multiple wildcards. The last wildcard is the most exploitable as it searches for trailing punctuation. This issue can be mitigated by Markdown to format user content instead of the urlize filter, or by implementing request timeouts and limiting process memory.

idna:2.8Vulnerable Dependency
idna[<3.7]0:ï¿½Advisory: CVE-2024-3651 impacts the idna.encode() function, where a specially crafted argument could lead to significant resource consumption, causing a denial-of-service. In version 3.7, this function has been updated to reject such inputs efficiently, minimizing resource use. A practical workaround involves enforcing a maximum domain name length of 253 characters before encoding, as the vulnerability is triggered by unusually large inputs that normal operations wouldn't encounter.

aiohttp:3.5.3Vulnerable Dependencyaiohttp[<3.9.0]0:ï¿½Advisory: Affected versions of aiohttp are vulnerable to an Improper Validation vulnerability. It is possible for an attacker to modify the HTTP request (e.g. insert a new header) or even create a new HTTP request if the attacker controls the HTTP method. The vulnerability occurs only if the attacker can control the HTTP method (GET, POST etc.) of the request. If the attacker can control the HTTP version of the request it will be able to modify the request (request smuggling).

aiohttp:3.5.3Vulnerable Dependencyaiohttp[>1.0.5,<3.9.2]0:ï¿½Advisory: The vulnerability lies in the improper configuration of static resource resolution when aiohttp is used as a web server. It occurs when the follow_symlinks option is enabled without proper validation, leading to directory traversal vulnerabilities. Unauthorized access to arbitrary files on the system could potentially occur. The affected versions are >1.0.5, and the issue was patched in version 3.9.2. As a workaround, it is advised to disable the follow_symlinks option outside of a restricted local development environment, especially in a server accepting requests from remote users. Using a reverse proxy server to handle static resources is also recommended.

aiohttp:3.5.3Vulnerable Dependencyaiohttp[<3.9.4]0:ï¿½Advisory: aiohttp is an asynchronous HTTP client/server framework for asyncio and Python. A XSS vulnerability exists on index pages for static file handling. This vulnerability is fixed in 3.9.4. We have always recommended using a reverse proxy server (e.g. nginx) for serving static files. Users following the recommendation are unaffected. Other users can disable `show_index` if unable to upgrade. See CVE-2024-27306.

aiohttp:3.5.3Vulnerable Dependencyaiohttp[<3.8.0]0:ï¿½	Advisory: Aiohttp 3.8.0 includes a fix for CVE-2023-47641: Affected versions of aiohttp have a security vulnerability regarding the inconsistent interpretation of the http protocol. HTTP/1.1 is a persistent protocol, if both Content-Length(CL) and Transfer-Encoding(TE) header values are present it can lead to incorrect interpretation of two entities that parse the HTTP and we can poison other sockets with this incorrect interpretation. A possible Proof-of-Concept (POC) would be a configuration with a reverse proxy(frontend) that accepts both CL and TE headers and aiohttp as backend. As aiohttp parses anything with chunked, we can pass a chunked123 as TE, the frontend entity will ignore this header and will parse Content-Length. The impact of this vulnerability is that it is possible to bypass any proxy rule, poisoning sockets to other users like passing Authentication Headers, also if it is present an Open Redirect an attacker could combine it to redirect random users to another website and log the request.
