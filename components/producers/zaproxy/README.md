# OWASP Zaproxy producer

This producer runs owasp zaproxy using its [automation framework](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/desktop/addons/automation-framework/) capabilities.
The producer takes one argument `producer-owasp-zaproxy-automation-framework-file-base64` which accepts a file generated by `zap.sh -cmd -autogenmin <file.yaml>` or `zap.sh -cmd -autogenmax <file.yaml>`, customized with the user's use case and encoded in base64 format.

## Automation Report section

For the producer to run, it is important that the report follows the template `traditional-json` and it is written in `/zap/wrk/out.json` you can do so with the following directives:

```yaml
  - type: report
    parameters:
      template: traditional-json
      reportDir: /zap/wrk
      reportFile: out.json

```

Every other part of the automation framework file is configurable.
