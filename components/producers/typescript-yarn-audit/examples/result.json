This can cause malformed URLs to be evaluated in unexpected ways by common redirect allow list implementations in Express applications, leading to an Open Redirect via bypass of a properly implemented allow list.\n\nThe main method impacted is `res.location()` but this is also called from within `res.redirect()`.\n\n### Patches\n\nhttps://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0867302ddbde0e9463d0564fea5861feb708c2dd\nhttps://github.com/expressjs/express/commit/0b746953c4bd8e377123527db11f9cd866e39f94\n\nAn initial fix went out with `express@4.19.0`, we then patched a feature regression in `4.19.1` and added improved handling for the bypass in `4.19.2`.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nThe fix for this involves pre-parsing the url string with either `require('node:url').parse` or `new URL`. These are steps you can take on your own before passing the user input string to `res.location` or `res.redirect`.\n\n### References\n\nhttps://github.com/expressjs/express/pull/5539\nhttps://github.com/koajs/koa/issues/1800\nhttps://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.location","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rv95-896h-c2vc"}}}

AngularJS users using JQuery should upgrade JQuery to 3.5.0, as a similar vulnerability [affects jQuery <3.5.0](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/security/advisories/GHSA-gxr4-xjj5-5px2).\n\n### Workarounds\nChanging sanitizer configuration not to allow certain tag grouping (e.g. `<option><style></option>`) or inline style elements may stop certain exploitation vectors, but it's uncertain if all possible exploitation vectors would be covered. Upgrade of AngularJS to 1.8.0 is recommended.\n\n### References\nhttps://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mhp6-pxh8-r675\nhttps://github.com/jquery/jquery/security/advisories/GHSA-gxr4-xjj5-5px2\nhttps://github.com/jquery/jquery/security/advisories/GHSA-jpcq-cgw6-v4j6\nhttps://blog.jquery.com/2020/04/10/jquery-3-5-0-released/\nhttps://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-ANGULAR-570058","url":"https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5cp4-xmrw-59wf"}}}
