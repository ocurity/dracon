## Producers

A producer is a program that parses the output of a tool and converts it into Dracon compatible file that can be used by the *enrichers* and *consumers*.

### Writing Producers

Producers can be written in any language that supports protobufs, we have examples in Golang and Python. They are all structured the same way:
1. Parse program arguments:
   1. `in`: the raw tool results file location
   2. `out`: where to place the Dracon compatible output file location
2. Parse the `in` file into Protobufs (`LaunchToolResponse`)
3. Add metadata to Protobufs (e.g. git/source-code information)
4. Write the protobuf bytes to the `out` file

### Producer API
For convenience, there are helper functions in the `./producers` pkg/module for Golang/Python.

The `WriteDraconOut`/`write_dracon_out` method expects a list of issues to write as the `LaunchToolResponse` protobuf. Your producer should parse the output of a tool results into `Issue` protobufs which are then passed into this method.
