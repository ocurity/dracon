pkg:pypi/urllib3@1.24.1Vulnerable Dependencyurllib3[<1.24.2]0:éAdvisory: Affected versions of urllib3 are vulnerable Improper Certificate Validation. Urllib3 mishandles certain cases where the desired set of CA certificates is different from the OS store of CA certificates, which results in SSL connections succeeding in situations where a verification failure is the correct outcome. This is related to the use of the ssl_context, ca_certs, or ca_certs_dir argument.

pkg:pypi/lxml@4.2.5Vulnerable Dependencylxml[<4.9.1]0:ÃAdvisory: Lxml 4.9.1 includes a fix for CVE-2022-2309: NULL Pointer Dereference allows attackers to cause a denial of service (or application crash). This only applies when lxml is used together with libxml2 2.9.10 through 2.9.14. libxml2 2.9.9 and earlier are not affected. It allows triggering crashes through forged input data, given a vulnerable code sequence in the application. The vulnerability is caused by the iterwalk function (also used by the canonicalize function). Such code shouldn't be in wide-spread use, given that parsing + iterwalk would usually be replaced with the more efficient iterparse function. However, an XML converter that serialises to C14N would also be vulnerable, for example, and there are legitimate use cases for this code sequence. If untrusted input is received (also remotely) and processed via iterwalk function, a crash can be triggered.

Advisory: Flask 2.2.5 and 2.3.2 include a fix for CVE-2023-30861: When all of the following conditions are met, a response containing data intended for one client may be cached and subsequently sent by the proxy to other clients. If the proxy also caches 'Set-Cookie' headers, it may send one client's 'session' cookie to other clients. The severity depends on the application's use of the session and the proxy's behavior regarding cookies. The risk depends on all these conditions being met:
1. The application must be hosted behind a caching proxy that does not strip cookies or ignore responses with cookies.
2. The application sets 'session.permanent = True'
3. The application does not access or modify the session at any point during a request.
4. 'SESSION_REFRESH_EACH_REQUEST' enabled (the default).
5. The application does not set a 'Cache-Control' header to indicate that a page is private or should not be cached.
This happens because vulnerable versions of Flask only set the 'Vary: Cookie' header when the session is accessed or modified, not when it is refreshed (re-sent to update the expiration) without being accessed or modified.

This is a product of how we use 'rebuild_proxies' to reattach the 'Proxy-Authorization' header to requests. For HTTP connections sent through the tunnel, the proxy will identify the header in the request itself and remove it prior to forwarding to the destination server. However when sent over HTTPS, the 'Proxy-Authorization' header must be sent in the CONNECT request as the proxy has no visibility into the tunneled request. This results in Requests forwarding proxy credentials to the destination server unintentionally, allowing a malicious actor to potentially exfiltrate sensitive information.

Staff members could use the TemplateDetailView view to check the existence of arbitrary files. Additionally, if (and only if) the default admindocs templates have been customized by application developers to also show file contents, then not only the existence but also the file contents would have been exposed. In other words, there is directory traversal outside of the template root directories.
