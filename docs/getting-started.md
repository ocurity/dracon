# Getting Started with Dracon

This guide will help to quickly setup Dracon on a Kubernetes cluster and get a
pipeline running. The first step is to create a dev Kubernetes cluster in order
to deploy Tekton. We suggest you use KiND to provision a local test cluster
quickly. If you already have a Kubernetes cluster then, you can follow the
steps highlighted on [Setup Dracon on another Kubernetes engine (Not recommended)](./setup-dracon-in-custom-k8s-engine.md).

We support two ways of deploying Dracon:

1. Using the Helm packages that we distribute, like shown in this document.
2. Using your local copy of this repository.
   Useful when you are developing components or new functionality.
   Please see [Custom Components](./custom-components.md)
   to learn more about this.

## Tools you will need

You will need to have the following tools installed in your system:

1. [KiND](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation)
2. [kustomize](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/installation/kustomize/)
3. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
4. [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
5. [Go](https://go.dev/)

## Deploying an example pipeline with Dracon

Following the steps below, we'll deploy an example Golang project
pipeline which will:

* Clone a Golang repository.
  This can be changed by updating the `git-clone-url`
  parameter in [pipelinerun.yaml](../examples/pipelines/golang-project)
* Scan the repository with [gosec](https://github.com/securego/gosec)
  and [nancy](https://github.com/sonatype-nexus-community/nancy)
* Enrich the findings with CODEOWNERS annotation
* Report the enriched results on [MongoDB](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo)
  and [ElasticSearch](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch)

### Set up Dracon and its dependencies

You can set up Dracon and its dependencies by executing `make install`.

This command will:

* spin up a Kubernetes cluster in Docker using [KinD](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/).
  TBD - if not KIND
* deploy Dracon dependencies and Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs).
  Most of these dependencies are required by the example pipelines:
  * MongoDB
  * Elasticsearch
  * Kibana
  * MongoDB
  * Postgres

All the dependencies are built using dracon's current [latest release](https://github.com/ocurity/dracon/tags).

This will take a while, so we invite you to go and grab a coffee!

### Deploy a pipeline

For example, we can deploy a pipeline for the `golang-project`.

You can do so by executing `./bin/cmd/path/to/draconctl ./examples/pipelines/golang-project`.

### Execute a pipeline

You can execute `kubectl create -n dracon -f ./examples/pipelines/golang-project/pipelinerun.yaml`.

### Watch the pipeline execute

You can follow the progress of the pipeline by checking
`Pods`,`PipelineRuns` and `TaskRuns` on `dracon`'s namespace.

Pipelines (`PipelineRuns`) are executed by multiple Tasks (`TaskRuns`)
which are deployed in containers running in pods.

You can monitor the status of a pipeline by executing:

```shell
kubectl get pipelineruns -w -n dracon
NAME                          SUCCEEDED   REASON    STARTTIME   COMPLETIONTIME
dracon-golang-project-7hqmc   True        Succeeded 24m         14m
```

And of its tasks by executing:

```shell
kubectl get taskruns -w -n dracon
NAME                                                 SUCCEEDED   REASON      STARTTIME   COMPLETIONTIME
dracon-golang-project-7hqmc-base                     True        Succeeded   27m         26m
dracon-golang-project-7hqmc-consumer-elasticsearch   True        Succeeded   23m         23m
dracon-golang-project-7hqmc-consumer-mongodb         True        Succeeded   23m         17m
dracon-golang-project-7hqmc-enricher-aggregator      True        Succeeded   24m         23m
dracon-golang-project-7hqmc-enricher-codeowners      True        Succeeded   24m         24m
dracon-golang-project-7hqmc-git-clone                True        Succeeded   27m         25m
dracon-golang-project-7hqmc-producer-aggregator      True        Succeeded   24m         24m
dracon-golang-project-7hqmc-producer-golang-gosec    True        Succeeded   25m         24m
dracon-golang-project-7hqmc-producer-golang-nancy    True        Succeeded   25m         24m
```

Finally, monitor the pods executing such tasks by executing:

```shell
kubectl get pods -w -n dracon
NAME                                                     READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
dracon-es-default-0                                      1/1     Running     0          24m
dracon-golang-project-7hqmc-base-pod                     0/1     Completed   0          22m
dracon-golang-project-7hqmc-consumer-elasticsearch-pod   0/1     Running     0          19m
dracon-golang-project-7hqmc-consumer-mongodb-pod         0/1     Running     0          19m
dracon-golang-project-7hqmc-enricher-aggregator-pod      0/2     Completed   0          19m
dracon-golang-project-7hqmc-enricher-codeowners-pod      0/2     Completed   0          19m
dracon-golang-project-7hqmc-git-clone-pod                0/2     Completed   0          22m
dracon-golang-project-7hqmc-producer-aggregator-pod      0/3     Completed   0          19m
dracon-golang-project-7hqmc-producer-golang-gosec-pod    0/3     Completed   0          21m
dracon-golang-project-7hqmc-producer-golang-nancy-pod    0/4     Completed   0          21m
dracon-kb-5df6fcb8c7-tsbg6                               1/1     Running     0          23m
dracon-postgresql-0                                      1/1     Running     0          25m
```

You can then check the enriched results stored in MongoDB and Elasticsearch.

### Debugging

If a few task don't complete, you can check their logs.

Usually you can simply tail the logs of an erroring pod
associated with such task by executing:

```shell
kubectl logs $podName $stepName 
```

For any error that is not related with some of you testing, please reach out.

## Develop a custom component

Now that you have completed our introduction, you can explore how to extend
Dracon for you needs by building your first component or pipeline.
