# How Dracon works

## Architecture

Dracon is using Tekton as a scheduling and execution layer on top of Kubernetes. Each component is
comprised of a binary that is wrapped in a container image and a Tekton Task object, which is a
Tekton CRD describing how the container will be used execute some quantum of processing.

## Components

Dracon has 3 types of components:

1. Producers: they run a binary with eg. some source code as input and produce some results
2. Enrichers: they use the output of one or more producers and enrich it with metadata
3. Consumers: they consume results from other jobs and redirect it to some sink, such as a database

Each Task must be labelled with the type of component that is packaed in the image it references.
The label must have the name `v1.dracon.ocurity.com/component` and the value must be one of:

1. consumer
2. producer
3. enricher

## Kustomize

We use kustomize as a build system for the Pipelines. A Pipeline is a Tekton CRD describing how a
number of Tasks are connected to each other to produce some result and store it in a database or
producer a ticket (or both).
Each component must define a Tekton Task object which is used as input to our `draconctl`
to produce a `kustomization.yaml`. This kustomization describes how a Task should be added to a
Pipeline.

## Helm

Helm is the last tool needed to deploy a Pipeline. We allow users to provide custom values for the
version of the Dracon components that they want to deploy and the container image repository from
where the images will be fetched. This allows users to build all our images themselves with
whatever base image they prefer, and to pin their installations to a specific version. All these
variables can be trivially configured using Helm.

## Running a pipeline

A Tekton Pipeline is a template of a sequence of steps that produce a meaningful result. The Tasks
of the pipeline will almost certainly require some parameterization. These parameters are passed to
and instantiation of a Pipeline using the PipelineRun object. You can check our examples folder to
various ways of combining our components to design pipelines for projects with a variety of
languages and frameworks.
