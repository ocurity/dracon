# Policy Enricher

Large (and small) teams would benefit from having a way to automatically make decisions about scan results.
This would allow them to custom tag results based on logic evaluation making it trivial to filter or otherwise manipulate results downstream.

## Requirements

As a user of this application I should be able to:

* Upload and manage a set of rules in some DSL
* Build policies in a user friendly way
* Have a set of example default policies available for testing
* Have Dracon apply the rules to the findings of a pipelinerun
* Get enriched results with information of which policies passed and which failed
* Control which policies apply to which pipeline

## Implementation

[OPA](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/) seems to be the leading policy engine nowadays. It's datalog based DSL for defining rules is easy-ish to use by developers and there are numerous integrations as well as widespread support for technologies and plugins.
We can use OPAs [rego package](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/open-policy-agent/opa/rego) to integrate a lighweight Rego evaluator as an enricher.

This way, policies can live in a filesystem as rego files and be managed accordingly.
The benefits of this approach is that users are more likely to already be familiar with Rego and then can use Styra's [DAS](https://www.styra.com/press/styra-introduces-rego-policy-builder/) offering to visually buld policies.

Minio is a convenient solution for a Rego file manager and it further allows for matching policies to pipelines by copying the policy in a folder named after the pipeline. Further, this enables the policy enricher to integrate with any solution that supports the S3 API.

### API changes

Currently the API dracon uses supports only the following fields in a raw finding:

```
string target = 1; // can be host:port or //foo/bar
string type = 2; // CWE-ID, etc for XSS, CSRF, etc.
string title = 3; // the vulnerability title from the tool
Severity severity = 4;
double cvss = 5;
Confidence confidence = 6;
string description = 7; // human readable description of the issue
string source = 8; // https://github.com/ocurity/dracon.git?ref=<revision>, github.com:tektoncd/pipeline.git?ref=<revision>, local?ref=local
string cve = 9; // [Optional] the CVE causing this vulnerability
```

and in an enriched finding:

```
Is  sue raw_issue = 1;
// The first time this issue was seen by the enrichment service
google.protobuf.Timestamp first_seen = 2;
// The number of times this issue was seen
uint64 count = 3;
// Whether this issue has been previously marked as a false positive
bool false_positive = 4;
// The last time this issue was updated
google.protobuf.Timestamp updated_at = 5;
// hash
string hash = 6;
```

These do not support enough information for the enricher to add policy information.
Thus the API will need to be extended with further fields. Due to the fact that an unknown number of policies will need to be evaluated, it is suggested that the following addition is made to the enriched finding message.

```

message EnrichedIssue {
  Issue raw_issue = 1;
  // The first time this issue was seen by the enrichment service
  google.protobuf.Timestamp first_seen = 2;
  // The number of times this issue was seen
  uint64 count = 3;
  // Whether this issue has been previously marked as a false positive
  bool false_positive = 4;
  // The last time this issue was updated
  google.protobuf.Timestamp updated_at = 5;
  // hash
  string hash = 6;

  map<string, string> annotations = 7;
}

```

This backwards compatible change allows dracon to optionally append policy information to a message.

### Enricher execution changes

Having multiple enrichers run in parallel would currently break message uniqueness.
Current consumer design assumes that any finding corresponds to a unique producer finding.
If we have multiple enrichers run in parallel then we will have finding dupication with different information appended to each version of a finding based on which enricher ran on it.
There are two suggested ways of preserving finding uniqueness while having multiple enrichers.

* The enricher phase can run enrichers in series randomising their execution order.
This would allow a quick and easy way of chaining a potentially large ammount of enrichers all while preserving finding uniqueness.
However performance would suffer drastically.
* The enricher phase can be pre-empted by a "message uniqueness" phase which adds a UUID to each enriched message.
Then enrichers can then run in parallel, followed by an aggregation phase which generates new messages adding all the information from each enricher to the specific message UUID.
